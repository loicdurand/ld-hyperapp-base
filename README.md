project cloned from https://github.com/ThobyV/hyperapp-rollup-babel-hyperapp-router, and set so that it is compatible with

my own https://github.com/loicdurand/ld-components library, and my own use!

# hyperapp-rollup-babel

> A simple starterpack for hyperapp applications - rollup, rollup-babel, hyperapp, hyperapp-router, rollup-sass.

## npm commands

```
npm install   // Install all dependencies
npm start     // Serve app on localhost and watch source files
npm run build    // create production ready files for deploying ( not tested yet ! )
```

**npm start** serves the app on http://localhost:8090
